TEST CASE:
	 
Equivalence class Partitioning:
	Equivalent Class Partitioning allows you to divide set of test condition into a partition which should be considered the same.This software testing method divides the domain of a program in to classes of data from which test cases should be designed.
Ex: Input condtion are valid between 1 to 10 and 20 to 30.
-10  to 0(invalid)   -2
   1 to 10(valid)     3
   11 to 19(invalid) 15
   20 to 30(valid)   25
   31 to --(invalid) 45
